**Team Allocation Simulator**

The "Team Allocation Simulator" is designed to solve the challenge of forming diverse and balanced teams from a large student population enrolled in the "Introduction to Data Science" course. Given the `records.csv` dataset of 6,000 students, our goal is to first create teams of five, before allowing the user to choose the number of students per group/team (`students_per_group`) between 4 - 10 students. The algorithm will ensure diversity in terms of school affiliation, gender, and CGPA with it being the main focus.

Throughout this project, we utilized computational thinking principles and Python programming to analyze the data and allocate teams fairly. In this report, we will walk through the various stages of the project, including importing necessary libraries and the dataset, analyzing the student data, designing the team allocation algorithm and evaluating the output data from the algorithm.
